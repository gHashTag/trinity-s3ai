## 2. Experiment Descriptions

### 2.1 HL-LHC (High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider)

The HL-LHC upgrade at CERN will deliver an integrated luminosity of ~3000 fb⁻¹ per experiment (ATLAS, CMS) by 2041, a factor of ~10 beyond Run 3. This enables precision Higgs coupling measurements at the percent level and a Higgs mass uncertainty reduction to approximately ±0.05 GeV. For Trinity S³AI, HL-LHC is the definitive test of the tree-level spectral-action Higgs mass (132.88 GeV), which is already refuted at 55.6σ. The HL-LHC will further tighten the bound, but the refutation is already conclusive. The retrospective fit m_H = 125.20 GeV will be tested for numerical stability — if HL-LHC finds a statistically significant deviation from 125.20 ± 0.05 GeV, the retrospective correlation weakens, though it does not acquire falsification status because it was not a prior prediction.

### 2.2 DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment)

DUNE is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using the LBNF beamline from Fermilab to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, 1300 km away. With four 10-kt liquid-argon time-projection chambers, DUNE will measure δ_CP with a precision of approximately ±5–10° by 2035, depending on the true value and exposure. First beam is expected in 2028, with physics data accumulation through 2038. For Trinity S³AI, the δ_CP = 65.66° prediction is **WITHDRAWN** (>5σ excluded by NuFIT-6.0 + T2K+NOvA 2025). It was a post-hoc fit, not a first-principles derivation. No replacement formula is introduced under the anti-post-hoc rule. DUNE will measure δ_CP with precision ±5–10° by 2035; regardless of the outcome, the Trinity δ_CP prediction does not survive. DUNE will also improve sin²θ₂₃ precision, which indirectly constrains any model with fixed generation-count coefficients.

### 2.3 JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory)

JUNO is a 20-kt liquid-scintillator reactor neutrino experiment in China designed to determine the neutrino mass ordering and measure oscillation parameters with sub-percent precision. Using eight reactor complexes at baselines ~53 km, JUNO targets Δm²₂₁ to ~0.6% and sin²θ₁₂ to ~0.5%. Startup and first physics data are expected in 2025, with full statistics by ~2030. For Trinity S³AI, JUNO tests the structural prediction Δm²₂₁/Δm²₃₁ = 0.0300 (P5), currently compatible at ~0.1σ. JUNO will independently measure both Δm² values, tightening the ratio uncertainty. A > 3σ deviation from 0.0300 would refute the structural formula π/(40φ²). JUNO also contributes to sin²θ₁₃ at the ~1% level, though this parameter is already known to high precision.

### 2.4 LZ (LUX-ZEPLIN)

LZ is a dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber located at SURF, with a 7-tonne active xenon mass and unprecedented low-background sensitivity. LZ-1 completed its first science run in 2023–2024, setting world-leading limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections. LZ-2, an upgrade with reduced backgrounds and increased exposure, is planned for 2026–2028. For Trinity S³AI, LZ-2 is the primary direct-detection probe of the WIMP mass predictions 12.82 GeV and 36.0 GeV. Current limits already exclude σ_SI > ~10⁻⁴⁷ cm² at ~10–40 GeV. LZ-2 will push this to ~10⁻⁴⁸ cm² or better. If LZ-2 excludes σ_SI > 10⁻⁴⁹ cm² at 12.82 GeV without signal, the WIMP interpretation of Trinity dark matter becomes untenable unless a specific cross-section prediction is provided by the theory.

### 2.5 XENONnT

XENONnT is the successor to XENON1T, operating at Gran Sasso with ~5.9 tonnes of liquid xenon. It has been taking data since 2021 and continues to set competitive WIMP limits, particularly in the 10–100 GeV mass range. XENONnT will run through approximately 2028, with potential upgrades (e.g., nT+) extending sensitivity. For Trinity S³AI, XENONnT provides complementary coverage to LZ-2, especially at masses around 12.82 GeV and 36.0 GeV. Combined LZ + XENONnT data by 2028 will likely probe σ_SI < 10⁻⁴⁸ cm² across the 10–50 GeV window. Absence of a signal at the predicted masses would force Trinity to either abandon the WIMP interpretation or predict a specific (and very small) cross-section.

### 2.6 DARWIN (Dark Matter WImp search with liquid xenoN)

DARWIN is a proposed next-generation multi-tonne liquid-xenon observatory (~50 tonnes), aiming for the ultimate sensitivity to WIMP dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay. If approved, construction could begin in the early 2030s, with data-taking starting around 2033–2035. DARWIN targets σ_SI < 10⁻⁴⁹ cm² for WIMP masses above ~10 GeV and will probe the neutrino fog — the irreducible background from coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. For Trinity S³AI, DARWIN represents the final direct-detection test: if no WIMP signal is found at 12.82 GeV or 36.0 GeV by 2035, the WIMP interpretation is effectively closed unless Trinity predicts a cross-section below the neutrino fog.

### 2.7 ADMX (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment)

ADMX is a microwave cavity haloscope searching for axion dark matter in the 1–10 μeV mass range (~0.2–2.5 GHz), corresponding to the QCD axion window. The experiment has been operational since the 1990s and has reached sensitivity to the KSVZ axion coupling in parts of its mass range. Upgrades (ADMX-Gen2) aim to extend coverage to higher masses and lower couplings by 2030. For Trinity S³AI, ADMX does not directly test the 12.8 THz prediction (which is far above microwave frequencies), but it establishes the experimental paradigm for axion/ALP searches. If Trinity's f₀ = 12.8 THz is reinterpreted as an axion-like particle mass (~0.053 meV), ADMX-style technology would need to be adapted to the THz regime.

### 2.8 CAST (CERN Axion Solar Telescope)

CAST searches for solar axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) using a decommissioned LHC dipole magnet as an axion helioscope. It has set leading limits on the axion-photon coupling g_{aγγ} for masses up to ~0.4 eV. The proposed IAXO (International AXion Observatory) would extend this sensitivity by 1–2 orders of magnitude, with construction potentially starting in the late 2020s. For Trinity S³AI, CAST/IAXO probes the ALP interpretation of the 12.8 THz line if the corresponding particle couples to photons. A 12.8 THz frequency corresponds to ~0.053 meV, well within the IAXO reach if the coupling is large enough. No positive signal from CAST or IAXO at this mass would constrain, but not definitively exclude, an ALP interpretation.

### 2.9 Euclid / DESI (Cosmological Surveys)

DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) has been operating at Kitt Peak since 2021, measuring baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift-space distortions for ~40 million galaxies and quasars. Euclid, launched by ESA in 2023, is mapping the geometry of the dark universe with weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. Both surveys will release final data around 2028–2030. For Trinity S³AI, these surveys already refute the cosmological predictions (F1–F7) by many orders of magnitude. Future releases will only tighten these bounds. The neutrino mass sum bound from DESI+Euclid+CMB (Σm_ν < 0.072 eV at 95% CL) definitively excludes m_ν₁ = 0.103 eV. No future cosmological data can rescue these predictions.

### 2.10 Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K)

Hyper-K is a next-generation water-Cherenkov detector in Japan, with a 188-kt fiducial mass (x25 Super-K), designed for precision neutrino oscillation physics, proton decay searches, and supernova neutrino detection. Construction is underway, with data-taking expected to begin around 2030. For Trinity S³AI, Hyper-K provides an independent long-baseline measurement of δ_CP (using the J-PARC neutrino beam) with precision comparable to DUNE in some channels. It also searches for proton decay, which, while not directly predicted by Trinity, is a key signature of grand unification that any finite-geometry model should address. Hyper-K's δ_CP measurement will cross-validate DUNE's result, either reinforcing or weakening the Trinity prediction.

### 2.11 FCC-hh (Future Circular Collider — hadron)

The FCC-hh is a proposed 100 TeV proton-proton collider at CERN, with a circumference of ~100 km. If approved, construction could begin in the 2040s, with physics data-taking starting around 2055–2060. For Trinity S³AI, FCC-hh would measure Higgs couplings to ~0.1% precision and potentially discover new physics that could explain the 7.78 GeV discrepancy in the tree-level Higgs mass prediction. However, the tree-level prediction m_H = 132.88 GeV is already refuted; FCC-hh would not change this conclusion.

### 2.12 ILC (International Linear Collider)

The ILC is a proposed 250 GeV (upgradeable to 500 GeV) electron-positron Higgs factory in Japan. If approved, construction could begin in the early 2030s, with first collisions around 2038–2040. The ILC would measure the Higgs mass to ~20 MeV and couplings to ~0.3% — the ultimate Higgs precision machine. For Trinity S³AI, the ILC would precisely test the numerical stability of the retrospective fit m_H = 125.20 GeV, though it cannot grant it prediction status.

### 2.13 THz Spectroscopy (Quasicrystal Labs)

High-resolution terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Raman spectroscopy of icosahedral quasicrystals (e.g., Al₆₃Cu₂₅Fe₁₂, i-YbMgZn) are ongoing in materials-science laboratories worldwide. Characteristic phonon and phason modes in these materials appear in the 0.5–20 THz range. For Trinity S³AI, a dedicated THz spectroscopy campaign searching for a sharp line at 12.8 ± 0.5 THz would directly test the f₀ prediction. As of 2026, no published high-resolution THz data in this specific band for icosahedral quasicrystals has been identified. This is the only experiment that can directly falsify P2.

## 6. Appendix B: Honest Assessment of Predictive Power

### B.1 What Trinity S³AI has genuinely predicted

As of Wave 13.6, the Trinity S³AI framework has **zero phenomenological predictions that were made prior to the corresponding experimental measurement and subsequently confirmed**. The registry records:

- **2 refuted prior predictions:** m_H(tree) = 132.88 GeV (refuted by LHC); Λ = φ⁻¹⁴⁴/2 (refuted by cosmology).
- **2 open predictions awaiting test:** δ_CP = 65.66° (DUNE 2028–2035); f₀ = 12.8 THz (no data).
- **2 retrospective fits:** m_H = 125.20 GeV (found after LHC 2012); sin²θ₁₃ = 0.02200 (corrected post-measurement).
- **1 structural compatibility:** Δm²₂₁/Δm²₃₁ = 0.0300 (compatible at 0.1σ, but not a prediction of a *new* quantity).
- **5 cosmological predictions:** All refuted by many orders of magnitude.

### B.2 What would constitute genuine progress

For Trinity S³AI to establish genuine predictive power, the following must occur:

1. **DUNE measures δ_CP ≈ 65.66° at 3σ significance.** This would be a non-trivial confirmation because the current best fit (197°) is far from the prediction. The formula `3/φ²` must have been registered *before* the measurement.

2. **THz spectroscopy finds a line at 12.8 ± 0.5 THz** in icosahedral quasicrystals with no known phonon explanation. This would open a new empirical window for the framework.

3. **LZ/DARWIN finds a WIMP at 12.82 GeV or 36.0 GeV** with a cross-section that Trinity can independently predict (currently missing).

4. **A rigorous derivation of any catalog formula** from the spectral triple axioms, producing a class **R** (rigorous) entry in the audit.

Until any of these occur, the honest assessment remains: **Trinity S³AI has produced rigorous mathematical results (η = −2, KO-dim 6) and honest boundary findings (boundary theorems BT-1–BT-7), but no confirmed phenomenological predictions.**
